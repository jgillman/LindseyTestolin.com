“I’ve worked with Lindsey on three book promotions and on each one, I’ve been amazed. What she delivered was always better than I’d even imagined was possible.”
<br><br>
-- Daniel H. Pink, author of A WHOLE NEW MIND and THE ADVENTURES OF JOHNNY BUNKO

× [DR. BRADFORD D. SMART](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bradford_D._Smart)
<br>
“Lindsey’s able to ‘get it,’ understand the goal, then take my general ideas, add her terrific creativity, and come with a truly powerful video. I look forward to doing more projects with her.”
<br><br>
-- Dr. Brad Smart, best-selling author and world authority on talent management

<br>
“A business book definitely raises its cool factor when it has its own movie style trailer. Check out this smart intro to The Adventures of Johnny Bunko: The Last Career Guide You’ll Ever Need. The new book from A Whole New Mind author Daniel Pink.”

× [TOMPETERS!](http://tompeters.com/entries.php?note=010332.php)
<br>
“This promotional video for [...] Dan Pink’s new book, The Adventures of Johnny Bunko, is pitch-perfect. It’s hip, it has a sense of humor, but most importantly it captures the energy and the message of the book.”

× [KANSASCITY.COM](http://blogs.kansascity.com/tvbarn/2008/04/wow-dan-pinks-a.html)
<br>
“The Adventures of Johnny Bunko [is] billed as the first American business book done entirely in manga. As if that weren’t genre-twisting enough, Dan’s ordered up a video trailer for his book ... and it kicks ass. Watch it for yourself and see if you don’t agree.”

<br>
“Riverhead Books and Penguin Books hired Lindsey Testolin to make the words of Daniel H. Pink and the illustrations of Rob Ten Pas come to life in the shape of a film trailer [...].”

<br>
“A lot of TLC went into this frenetic Dada fever dream created by Lindsey Testolin for Twin Cities band Love in October. It has the anxious energy of Virgil Widrich’s Fast Film and bits of it remind me of Jonas Odell’s stuff, but "An Average Idea" is a little more DIY, a little more off-the-cuff.”

Tom Schroeder mentions my work on his Sundance-featured film:
<br><br>
“[...] I also wanted to try combining my drawn character style with Lindsey Testolin’s collage cut-out style (she did all the background environments in the film).”

“[...] Cracks me up every time I watch it.”

× [ANTVILLE.ORG](http://videos.antville.org/stories/1737735)
<br>
“One of the best music videos of 2007.”

× [MNARTISTS.ORG](http://www.mnartists.org/ejournal/accessENGAGEIssue32.2.htm#mashup)
<br>
“A jangly, percussive dance of cut-out photographs”

× [OH! VIDEO MAGAZIN](http://blog.ohtv.de/blog/show/145)
<br>
“[Presenting a] beautiful video from Lindsey Testolin. With crazy collages and so on.”

<br>
“Essentially two minutes of Monty Python cut-outs on acid, the video was directed by Minneapolis local Lindsey Testolin [...]. We recommend viewing [Testolin’s work] at full screen after two tabs.”
