“I’ve worked with Lindsey on four book promotions and on each one, I’ve been amazed. What she delivered was always better than I’d even imagined was possible.”
<br><br>
-- Daniel H. Pink, author of A WHOLE NEW MIND and DRIVE

I recently made several videos for The Atlantic Monthly on how energy really works in America. Check it out! This six part series of animated explainers was written by Alexis Madrigal and produced by Kasia Cieplak-Mayr von Baldegg.

“One of the best examples of video-branding for authors.”

“I can honestly say that working with Lindsey was the easiest part of the entire book process. She is one of the most talented, pleasant, and imaginative individuals whom I have ever met. If you want to create a trailer to promote your book, or get readers to consider a unique slant on its message, I suggest that you allow Lindsey to work her magic. You won’t be disappointed.”

-- Garret Kramer, founder of Inner Sports and author of STILLPOWER

“Saving the world, one author at a time.”

“A business book definitely raises its cool factor when it has its own movie style trailer. Check out this smart intro to The Adventures of Johnny Bunko: The Last Career Guide You’ll Ever Need. The new book from A Whole New Mind author Daniel Pink.”

“It’s a fantastic example of how a video presentation can tell a short, powerful story to sell an idea. Production credit goes to the very talented Lindsey Testolin.”

Director Lindsey J. Testolin took home two Tellys for Daniel H. Pink’s book trailer “The Adventures of Johnny Bunko”. Penguin Group (USA). Online Commercial Category & Internet Promotions.

“The Adventures of Johnny Bunko [is] billed as the first American business book done entirely in manga. As if that weren’t genre-twisting enough, Dan’s ordered up a video trailer for his book ... and it kicks ass. Watch it for yourself and see if you don’t agree.”

“A lot of TLC went into this frenetic Dada fever dream created by Lindsey Testolin for Twin Cities band Love in October. It has the anxious energy of Virgil Widrich’s Fast Film and bits of it remind me of Jonas Odell’s stuff, but "An Average Idea" is a little more DIY, a little more off-the-cuff.”

Tom Schroeder mentions my work on his Sundance-featured film:
<br><br>
“[...] I also wanted to try combining my drawn character style with Lindsey Testolin’s collage cut-out style (she did all the background environments in the film).”

“Essentially two minutes of Monty Python cut-outs on acid, the video was directed by Minneapolis local Lindsey Testolin [...]. We recommend viewing [Testolin’s work] at full screen after two tabs.”
