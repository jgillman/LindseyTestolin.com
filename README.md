# Stacey 2.0.1

## Overview
Stacey takes content from .txt files, image files and implied directory structure and generates a static website. 
It is a no-database, dynamic website generator.

If you look in the /content and /templates folders, you should get the general idea of how it all works.

## Installation

Copy to server, chmod 777 app/_cache, rename htacess file to .htaccess.
